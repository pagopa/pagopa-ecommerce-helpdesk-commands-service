## Spring Boot Native
### Requirements
1. You must use GraalVM Java SDK to build native executable locally.
   https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/. It is recommended to use SDKMAN
2. You must use GraalVM gradle plugin which allows to configure a lot of setting for native compilation, like automatic toolchain detection https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/gradle-plugin.html

If you're experiencing issue with GraalVM not found like errors, be sure to use GraalVM for the project and try to enable automatic toolchain detection.
Also, you can use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/install) to provide a better JVM env "switching".


#### Compile & Run
To compile microservice to native executable you can use the following gradle task:
```shell
gradle :nativeCompile
```
This will produce an executable inside `build/native/nativeCompile/`

N.B. Compiling into a native executable takes a long time. Locally, it is recommended to launch it normally (in java) in order to test the service.

Also exist a gradle command to compile and run it directly:
```shell
gradle :nativeRun
```

#### Tips
The main issue with native image is related to Java Reflection.
GraalVM produces a metadata files containing reflection data.  There is also a repository containing the metadata of some of the most widely used external libraries. You can include this metadata via the gradle plugin
```gradle
graalvmNative {
    metadataRepository {
        enabled.set(true)
        version.set("0.2.6")
    }
}
```

Spring using AOT try automatically to do the best, but you can also find issues.
Here https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html#aot.hints you can find a lot of tips, like `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` 

#### Dependency lock

This feature use the content of `gradle.lockfile` to check the declared dependencies against the locked one.

If a transitive dependencies have been upgraded the build will fail because of the locked version mismatch.

The following command can be used to upgrade dependency lockfile:

```shell
./gradlew dependencies --write-locks 
```

Running the above command will cause the `gradle.lockfile` to be updated against the current project dependency
configuration

#### Dependency verification

This feature is enabled by adding the gradle `./gradle/verification-metadata.xml` configuration file.

Perform checksum comparison against dependency artifact (jar files, zip, ...) and metadata (pom.xml, gradle module
metadata, ...) used during build
and the ones stored into `verification-metadata.xml` file raising error during build in case of mismatch.

The following command can be used to recalculate dependency checksum:

```shell
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 clean spotlessApply build --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies
```

In the above command the `clean`, `spotlessApply` `build` tasks where chosen to be run
in order to discover all transitive dependencies used during build and also the ones used during
spotless apply task used to format source code.

The above command will upgrade the `verification-metadata.xml` adding all the newly discovered dependencies' checksum.
Those checksum should be checked against a trusted source to check for corrispondence with the library author published
checksum.

`/gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256` command appends all new dependencies to the verification files but does
not remove
entries for unused dependencies.

This can make this file grow every time a dependency is upgraded.

To detect and remove old dependencies make the following steps:

1. Delete, if present, the `gradle/verification-metadata.dryrun.xml`
2. Run the gradle write-verification-metadata in dry-mode (this will generate a verification-metadata-dryrun.xml file
   leaving untouched the original verification file)
3. Compare the verification-metadata file and the verification-metadata.dryrun one checking for differences and removing
   old unused dependencies

The 1-2 steps can be performed with the following commands

```Shell
rm -f ./gradle/verification-metadata.dryrun.xml 
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 clean spotlessApply build --dry-run
```

The resulting `verification-metadata.xml` modifications must be reviewed carefully checking the generated
dependencies checksum against official websites or other secure sources.

If a dependency is not discovered during the above command execution it will lead to build errors.

You can add those dependencies manually by modifying the `verification-metadata.xml`
file adding the following component:

```xml

<verification-metadata>
    <!-- other configurations... -->
    <components>
        <!-- other components -->
        <component group="GROUP_ID" name="ARTIFACT_ID" version="VERSION">
            <artifact name="artifact-full-name.jar">
                <sha256 value="sha value"
                        origin="Description of the source of the checksum value"/>
            </artifact>
            <artifact name="artifact-pom-file.pom">
                <sha256 value="sha value"
                        origin="Description of the source of the checksum value"/>
            </artifact>
        </component>
    </components>
</verification-metadata>
```

Add those components at the end of the components list and then run the

```shell
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 clean spotlessApply build --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies
```

that will reorder the file with the added dependencies checksum in the expected order.

Finally, you can add new dependencies both to gradle.lockfile writing verification metadata running

```shell
 ./gradlew dependencies --write-locks --write-verification-metadata sha256 --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies
```
