# PagoPA Help desk Commands Service

## Overview
`pagopa-ecommerce-helpdesk-commands-service` is a Kotlin-based microservice designed to support manual operations, such as refunds, for transactions related to the pagoPA ecommerce platform. 
This service leverages Kotlin's native compilation to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- Kotlin
- Spring Boot (native)

## Quick Start - Testing Local APIs

Get the service running quickly to test the basic APIs:

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 (GraalVM recommended)
- Gradle 8.2+
- Docker Desktop
- GitHub personal access token with `packages:read` permission

### GitHub Token Setup

To access the `pagopa-ecommerce-commons` library from GitHub Packages, you need to set up authentication:

1. Create a GitHub personal access token with `packages:read` permission
2. Set the token as an environment variable:

```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_with_packages_read_permission
```

### 4-Step Setup

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Start required services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up mongo-ecommerce pagopa-npg-mock pagopa-psp-mock -d
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local.spring | xargs) && gradle bootRun
   ```

4. **Test with Postman:**
   - Import collection: `api-tests/v1/helpdeskcommands.api.tests.local.json`
   - Import environment: `api-tests/env/helpdeskcommands_local.env.json`
   - Run the collection against `http://localhost:8080`

### API Authentication

All `/commands/*` endpoints require API key authentication using the `x-api-key` header. The valid API keys are configured in the environment variables:
- `SECURITY_API_KEYS_PRIMARY=primary-key` (default)
- `SECURITY_API_KEYS_SECONDARY=secondary-key` (alternative)

### Quick API Test with cURL

Test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

Test a refund operation (example transaction ID):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/commands/transactions/ecf06892c9e04ae39626dfdfda631b94/refund \
--header 'x-api-key: primary-key' \
--header 'deployment: green' \
--header 'X-User-Id: user-id' \
--header 'X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.1'
```

Test a resend email operation:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/commands/transactions/ecf06892c9e04ae39626dfdfda631b94/resend-email \
--header 'x-api-key: primary-key' \
--header 'deployment: green' \
--header 'X-User-Id: user-id' \
--header 'X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.1'
```

### Environment Files

Choose the appropriate environment file based on your testing approach:

- **`.env.example`**: Template with all variables for Docker Compose testing (container hostnames)
- **`.env.local.spring`**: Ready-to-use for Spring Boot JVM testing (localhost services)
- **`.env.dev`**: User-created from `.env.example` for dev environment (contains secrets, not in repo)

### Environment variables

These are all environment variables needed by the application:

An example configuration of these environment variables is in the `.env.example` file.

It is recommended to create a new .env file by copying the example one, using the following command (make sure you are in the .env.example folder):

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

## Working with Windows

If you are developing on Windows, it is recommended the use of WSL2 combined with IntelliJ IDEA.

The IDE should be installed on Windows, with the repository cloned into a folder in WSL2. All the necessary tools will be installed in the Linux distro of your choice.

You can find more info on how to set up the environment following the link below.

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html

After setting up the WSL environment, you can test the application by building it through either Spring Boot or Docker.

## Spring Boot Native
### Requirements
1. You must use GraalVM Java SDK to build native executable locally.
   https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/. It is recommended to use SDKMAN
2. You must use GraalVM gradle plugin which allows to configure a lot of setting for native compilation, like automatic toolchain detection https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/gradle-plugin.html

If you're experiencing issue with GraalVM not found like errors, be sure to use GraalVM for the project and try to enable automatic toolchain detection.
Also, you can use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/install) to provide a better JVM env "switching".

### eCommerce Commons Library

The service uses the `pagopa-ecommerce-commons` library which is now distributed via GitHub Packages. The library version is configured in `build.gradle.kts`.
These two properties in `build.gradle.kts` control the `ecommerce-commons` version and git reference:

```kotlin
object Deps {
  const val ecommerceCommonsVersion = "3.0.2" // ecommerce commons wanted pom version
  const val ecommerceCommonsGitRef = ecommerceCommonsVersion // the branch/tag to be checked out
}
```

`ecommerceCommonsGitRef` has by default the same value as `ecommerceCommonsVersion`, so the version tagged
with `"x.y.z"` will be checked out and installed locally.

This value was left as a separate property because, during development phases, it can be changed to a feature branch,
making the local build use a ref branch other than a tag for development purposes.

The library is automatically downloaded from GitHub Packages during the build process using the configured GitHub token.

You also need one of:
 - an azurite instance running locally
 - use DEV values

According to the choice, please adjust accordingly:
 - `ECOMMERCE_STORAGE_TRANSIENT_CONNECTION_STRING`
 - `TRANSACTION_REFUND_QUEUE_NAME`
 - `TRANSACTION_NOTIFICATIONS_QUEUE_NAME`

#### Compile & Run
To compile microservice to native executable you can use the following gradle task:
```shell
gradle :nativeCompile
```
This will produce an executable inside `build/native/nativeCompile/`

N.B. Compiling into a native executable takes a long time. Locally, it is recommended to launch it normally (in java) in order to test the service.

Also exist a gradle command to compile and run it directly:
```shell
gradle :nativeRun
```

If you want to run the project locally with Spring Boot, you should initialize npg-mock and psp-mock using the following commands (you need yarn installed on the WSL):

```shell
yarn add json-server@0.17.4 --exact
```

The following command should be used to start the mock server for local testing

```shell
yarn json-server ./npg-server.json --routes ./routes.json --middlewares ./middleware.js --host=0.0.0.0
yarn json-server ./psp-server.json --routes ./routes.json --middlewares ./middleware.js --host=0.0.0.0
```

#### Test Coverage
To generate test coverage reports, run:
```shell
gradle jacocoTestReport
```
The coverage report will be generated at `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`. Open this file in a browser to view detailed coverage metrics.

## Docker

The project can be built and run using Docker and docker-compose. You should install Docker Desktop on Windows and go through its settings to set up the WSL integration.

You can find more info at the following link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/

After setting up Docker, you can use the command:

```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_with_packages_read_permission
docker-compose up --build
```

The docker-compose up command will build the image and start the containers.

## Integration Testing

This service supports two integration testing approaches:

### Local Integration Testing (Docker Compose)
Run integration tests using the local Docker Compose setup:

1. Start the local environment:
   ```shell
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Run tests using the Postman collections (see "Using Postman Collections" section below)

### eCommerce-Local Integration Testing
The service is integrated into the [pagopa-ecommerce-local](https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-ecommerce-local) repository for comprehensive platform testing.

**Pipeline Integration**: The CI/CD pipeline includes an `IntegrationTestEcommerceLocal` stage that:
- Dynamically sets the service branch using `ECOMMERCE_HELPDESK_COMMANDS_COMMIT_SHA` 
- Runs tests in the full ecommerce environment

**Polling Tests**: Integration tests include transaction state polling to verify:
- Refund operations: Transaction state transitions through Azure Storage Queues and Event Dispatcher
- Email resend operations: Notification request processing via queue-based messaging

**Dependencies**: The service depends on:
- `storage` (Azurite) - for Azure Storage Queue emulation
- `mongo` - for transaction state persistence  
- `pagopa-npg-mock`, `pagopa-psp-mock` - for payment gateway mocking
- `pagopa-ecommerce-event-dispatcher-service` - for queue message processing

#### Tips
The main issue with native image is related to Java Reflection.
GraalVM produces a metadata files containing reflection data.  There is also a repository containing the metadata of some of the most widely used external libraries. You can include this metadata via the gradle plugin
```gradle
graalvmNative {
    metadataRepository {
        enabled.set(true)
        version.set("0.2.6")
    }
}
```

Spring using AOT try automatically to do the best, but you can also find issues.
Here https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html#aot.hints you can find a lot of tips, like `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` 

#### Dependency lock

This feature use the content of `gradle.lockfile` to check the declared dependencies against the locked one.

If a transitive dependencies have been upgraded the build will fail because of the locked version mismatch.

The following command can be used to upgrade dependency lockfile:

```shell
./gradlew dependencies --write-locks 
```

Running the above command will cause the `gradle.lockfile` to be updated against the current project dependency
configuration

#### Dependency verification

This feature is enabled by adding the gradle `./gradle/verification-metadata.xml` configuration file.

Perform checksum comparison against dependency artifact (jar files, zip, ...) and metadata (pom.xml, gradle module
metadata, ...) used during build
and the ones stored into `verification-metadata.xml` file raising error during build in case of mismatch.

The following command can be used to recalculate dependency checksum:

```shell
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 clean spotlessApply build --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies
```

In the above command the `clean`, `spotlessApply` `build` tasks where chosen to be run
in order to discover all transitive dependencies used during build and also the ones used during
spotless apply task used to format source code.

The above command will upgrade the `verification-metadata.xml` adding all the newly discovered dependencies' checksum.
Those checksum should be checked against a trusted source to check for corrispondence with the library author published
checksum.

`/gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256` command appends all new dependencies to the verification files but does
not remove
entries for unused dependencies.

This can make this file grow every time a dependency is upgraded.

To detect and remove old dependencies make the following steps:

1. Delete, if present, the `gradle/verification-metadata.dryrun.xml`
2. Run the gradle write-verification-metadata in dry-mode (this will generate a verification-metadata-dryrun.xml file
   leaving untouched the original verification file)
3. Compare the verification-metadata file and the verification-metadata.dryrun one checking for differences and removing
   old unused dependencies

The 1-2 steps can be performed with the following commands

```Shell
rm -f ./gradle/verification-metadata.dryrun.xml 
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 clean spotlessApply build --dry-run
```

The resulting `verification-metadata.xml` modifications must be reviewed carefully checking the generated
dependencies checksum against official websites or other secure sources.

If a dependency is not discovered during the above command execution it will lead to build errors.

You can add those dependencies manually by modifying the `verification-metadata.xml`
file adding the following component:

```xml

<verification-metadata>
    <!-- other configurations... -->
    <components>
        <!-- other components -->
        <component group="GROUP_ID" name="ARTIFACT_ID" version="VERSION">
            <artifact name="artifact-full-name.jar">
                <sha256 value="sha value"
                        origin="Description of the source of the checksum value"/>
            </artifact>
            <artifact name="artifact-pom-file.pom">
                <sha256 value="sha value"
                        origin="Description of the source of the checksum value"/>
            </artifact>
        </component>
    </components>
</verification-metadata>
```

Add those components at the end of the components list and then run the

```shell
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 clean spotlessApply build --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies
```

that will reorder the file with the added dependencies checksum in the expected order.

Finally, you can add new dependencies both to gradle.lockfile writing verification metadata running

```shell
 ./gradlew dependencies --write-locks --write-verification-metadata sha256 --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies
```

following [article](https://docs.gradle.org/8.1/userguide/dependency_verification.html#sec:checksum-verification)

## Testing event-based APIs with DEV Environment

This section provides instructions for testing the helpdesk commands event-based APIs using the dev environment with real Azure Storage queues and MongoDB.

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 (GraalVM recommended for native compilation)
- Gradle
- Access to dev environment (MongoDB and Azure Storage)

### APIs Available

1. **Request Transaction Refund** - `POST /commands/transactions/{transactionId}/refund`
2. **Resend Transaction Email** - `POST /commands/transactions/{transactionId}/resend-email`

Both APIs return HTTP 202 (Accepted) and send events to dev Azure Storage Queues for async processing.

### Environment Setup

1. **Configure environment variables** by creating `.env.dev`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.dev
```

2. **Environment should include**:
   - Dev MongoDB connection settings
   - Dev Azure Storage connection string and queue names
   - `AZURE_QUEUE_NATIVE_CLIENT_ENABLED=true` for native compilation

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the application with dev environment
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.dev | xargs) && gradle bootRun

# For native compilation (production-like testing)
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.dev | xargs) && ./build/native/nativeCompile/pagopa-helpdesk-commands-service
```

### Testing with curl

Use real transaction IDs from the dev database:

**Request Transaction Refund:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/commands/transactions/{REFUNDABLE_TRANSACTION_ID}/refund \
--header 'x-api-key: primary-key' \
--header 'deployment: green' \
--header 'X-User-Id: user-id' \
--header 'X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.1'
```

**Resend Transaction Email:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/commands/transactions/{NOTIFICATION_RESEND_TRANSACTION_ID}/resend-email \
--header 'x-api-key: primary-key' \
--header 'deployment: green' \
--header 'X-User-Id: user-id' \
--header 'X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.1'
```

**Expected Results:**
- Both APIs should return **HTTP 202 Accepted**
- Empty response body (async processing)
- Logs should show successful message sending to dev Azure Storage queues

### Using Postman Collections

#### Local Environment Testing (CI/CD Compatible)
1. **Import collection**: `api-tests/v1/helpdeskcommands.api.tests.local.json`
2. **Import environment**: `api-tests/env/helpdeskcommands_local.env.json`
3. **Contains**: 6 APIs compatible with local Docker environment
4. **Used by**: CI/CD integration tests

#### Event-Based API Testing
1. **Import collection**: `api-tests/v1/helpdeskcommands.api.tests.event-based.json`
2. **Import environment**: `api-tests/env/helpdeskcommands_local.env.json`
3. **Set variables**:
   - `HOSTNAME`: `http://localhost:8080` (your local running app)
   - `TRANSACTION_ID`: Use `REFUNDABLE_TRANSACTION_ID`/`NOTIFICATION_RESEND_TRANSACTION_ID` from `api-tests/env/helpdeskcommands_dev.env.json` or real transaction ID from dev database
   - Authentication headers as required

4. **Contains**: 4 event-based APIs (2 success + 2 error/not found scenarios)
5. **Requirements**: Dev environment with real Azure Storage queues

**Note**: Event-based APIs require dev environment connectivity and are NOT included in automated CI testing.
They are included in automated testing after deploying to DEV and UAT environments (`api-tests/v1/helpdeskcommands.api.tests.dev.json`
and `api-tests/v1/helpdeskcommands.api.tests.uat.json` are used in those cases).
